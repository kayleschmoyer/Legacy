/**
 * TestData — the backend-agnostic data-precondition seam (ADR-0016).
 *
 * A dual-mode spec never seeds data itself; it asks this interface to
 * *ensure a precondition holds* and gets back the handles it needs to assert.
 * Each backend satisfies the precondition its own way:
 *
 *   • {@link MockTestData} installs `route.fulfill()` handlers over the
 *     hermetic baseline (layer-3 overrides, LIFO ahead of api-isolation).
 *   • {@link LiveTestData} relies on (or creates via real GraphQL) state on
 *     the live backend, and returns handles that are stable there.
 *
 * Methods return the SAME shape in both modes so the spec body is identical;
 * only the returned values differ (mock fixtures vs. live data). Grow this
 * interface verb-by-verb as dual-mode specs need new preconditions — a verb
 * without a live implementation should throw, not silently no-op.
